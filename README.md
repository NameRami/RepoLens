# RepoLens

A polished local GitHub repository intelligence dashboard built with **TypeScript**, **Express**, and a custom frontend UI.

RepoLens analyzes a GitHub user's public repositories, ranks them using a scoring system, and displays portfolio-style insights with charts, cards, filters, and direct repository links.

## Requirements

Install Node.js first:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

Recommended Node version: Node 20 or newer.

---

## Installation

```bash
npm install
```

---

## GitHub Token Setup

A GitHub token is recommended because unauthenticated GitHub API requests have lower rate limits.

Create a token here:

```text
https://github.com/settings/tokens
```

Suggested setup:

1. Go to **GitHub Settings**
2. Open **Developer settings**
3. Open **Personal access tokens**
4. Choose **Tokens classic** or a fine-grained token
5. Generate a token
6. Copy it immediately

For public repository analysis, broad permissions are not required. Public read access is enough.

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
GITHUB_TOKEN=your_token_here
PORT=3000
```

Do not commit `.env` to GitHub. It is already ignored by `.gitignore`.

---

## Run Locally

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then open:

```text
http://localhost:3000
```

Enter a GitHub username and click **Analyze profile**.

Example usernames:

```text
namerami
torvalds
vercel
```

---

## Build and Run Production Version

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

Then open:

```text
http://localhost:3000
```

## API Endpoint

```text
GET /api/analyze/:username
```

Example:

```text
http://localhost:3000/api/analyze/torvalds
```

Response includes:

* ranked repositories
* language distribution
* total stars
* total forks
* recently updated repository count
* top repositories by score

---

## Scoring Logic

Repositories are scored using:

* stars
* forks
* watchers
* recent activity
* description presence
* homepage presence
* topics
* license
* repository size sanity
* non-archived status

The scoring logic lives in:

```text
src/score.ts
```

You can tune the weights there.

---

## Upload to GitHub

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: RepoLens dashboard"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin <your-repo-url>
git push -u origin main
```

Recommended GitHub topics:

```text
typescript
express
github-api
dashboard
developer-tools
portfolio
repository-analysis
```

## Notes

RepoLens intentionally avoids native charting dependencies. Charts are rendered with custom browser-based HTML and CSS, so the project stays stable on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
